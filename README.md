# TechDegree-Unit-2: LIST PAGINATION & FILTERING

The goal of this project was to dynamically create a working page with any givien list of students. The goal was to only show ten users per page and dynamically create page links that let you navigate back in forth between pages. The big focus of this project was looping through arrays for the purpose of:
1. making css changes to display users
2. creating new elements to be appended to the page
3. adding event listeners to fire when page buttons were clicked

This project was originally completed **Dec 10 2018**.

As of **Jan 19 2020** it has been refactored and updated to show my growth.

A `fun` next step would be to make this page a little more interactive by allowing users to select their list size, maybe by increments of 5, 10, 20 with 10 being the default.  ðŸ˜‰ stay tuned this might just become a thing!
